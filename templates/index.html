<h1>Tumblr Backup</h1>

<h2 class="text-muted">Download all your posts on Tumblr</h2>

<p>Well, not realy <i>all</i>. Currently only text and photo posts are supported.</p>

<p><a href="/auth/tumblr/login">Login</a> with your Tumblr account, choose one of your blogs and click "download". You'll get a zip archive containing <code>.html</code> files, one per post, with comments and tags. Open them in a browser.</p>
